    <string name="lsvt_description">LSVT BIG® is a specialized exercise program designed to help individuals with Parkinson’s disease improve their mobility, balance, and overall movement. By using exaggerated, high-amplitude motions, it retrains the brain and body to overcome the small, slow movements often caused by Parkinson’s. Regular sessions can enhance walking, reduce fall risk, increase confidence in daily tasks, and support greater independence. With consistent practice, LSVT BIG® can significantly boost quality of life and functional ability for those living with Parkinson’s.</string>
